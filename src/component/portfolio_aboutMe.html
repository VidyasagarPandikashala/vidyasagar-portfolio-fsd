              of experience, I ventured into the field of Web Development. What

            <p class="para_18">
              During my tenure as a mechanical engineer, I had the opportunity
              to work on diverse projects, one of which was an
              <strong>Aftermarket project</strong>. It was during my involvement
              with this project that I became familiar with
              <strong>the web development team </strong> responsible for its
              implementation. My interest in
              <strong>
                web development steadily grew as I engaged with the
                team,</strong
              >
              gaining valuable insights into their work. Encouraged by this
              newfound curiosity, I was entrusted with a web development task by
              the team. This experience solidified my commitment to
              transitioning from mechanical engineering to a career in web
              development.
